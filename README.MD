About the Game
This game is a Metroidvania-style game.

Metroidvanias are a subgenre of platformers that emphasize exploration, backtracking, and gaining abilities to access new areas. 
Unlike traditional platformers, which consist of separate, self-contained stages, a Metroidvania features a large, interconnected world. 
Players navigate through this expansive area, encountering various obstacles and enemies.

Key Features of Metroidvania Games:

Exploration: Players explore a vast, open world with numerous paths and hidden secrets.

Backtracking: As players acquire new abilities and power-ups, they can return to previously inaccessible areas to discover new items and progress further.

Power-Ups: New abilities and power-ups are essential for overcoming challenges and unlocking new regions of the map.

Non-linear Progression: The game allows for non-linear progression, meaning players can tackle challenges in different orders and make choices about where to go and what to do next.
